# DAY 9 üëæ 

### I'm back üíô

#### Today I created Github Trending Repos JSON API. I've created this app to daily get updates about Github Trending Repos from 1 place rather than always checking 
[Github Trending Repos](https://github.com/trending). 

### [The JSON API can be found here](https://github.com/deadcoder0904/github-trending-json-api).

It gives repo description & the link to the repo. 

## The API is in the following format

This project looks very simple, but it was very tricky because it was my first time using [Nightmare JS](https://nightmarejs.org). Nightmare is a High Level Automation Library made using Electron. It is same as [Phantom JS](http://phantomjs.org/), but it is fast & a little modern.

### To scrape today's trending, follow the steps given below :-

# (1) Clone this repo

{% vimhl bash true %}
$ git clone git@github.com:deadcoder0904/github-trending-json-api.git
{% endvimhl %}

# (2) Go into the directory

{% vimhl bash true %}
$ cd github-trending-json-api
{% endvimhl %}

# (3) Type `yarn` to install all dependencies

{% vimhl bash true %}
$ yarn
{% endvimhl %}

# (4) Type `yarn start` to start scraping the web

{% vimhl bash true %}
$ yarn start
{% endvimhl %}

### In a minutes time, depending on the speed of your internet, a new file will be created according to today's date in `json` folder.

## Voila, we have scraped the web together. It has many more applications further. We can login to Facebook & Twitter using Nightmare. We can send Automated Emails using Nightmare & many more things....

###### ‚ö† Warning : It scrapes the [Github Trending Site](https://github.com/trending) which means that if the sites layout changes this project won't work

### Till the next time üëª
