# DAY 8 ðŸ‘¾ 

### I'm back ðŸ’™

#### Today I created a fun Web App of my awesome collection of Quotes. I've created this app to remember some Quotes & if u know me personally, you'll hear one of them soon enough. 

#### If I need to add a new Quote I manually don't have to edit the HTML or JS file, I just need to add 2 lines to the JSON file & the new quote will appear on the browser like a charm.

#### If u find an awesome Quote, send me a pull request [here](https://github.com/deadcoder0904/a2k-quotes)
