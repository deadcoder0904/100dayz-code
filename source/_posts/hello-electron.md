# DAY 2 ðŸ‘¾ 

### I'm back ðŸ’™

#### For a longtime, I wanted to create a Desktop App which is platform independent, viz, it can run on different Operating Systems like Windows, Linux, Mac, Fedora, Open SUSE, Android, etc..

### Thanx to [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), a cross platform Desktop App. 

# According to the Site ----

{% blockquote %}
If you can build a website, you can build a desktop app. Electron is a framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It takes care of the hard parts so you can focus on the core of your application.
{% endblockquote %}

Therefore, I created a Simple Desktop App that opens up this [Blog's HomePage](https://100dayz.js.org). Its very easy app. I just wanted to start a Simple Hello Electron App so I created [this one](https://github.com/deadcoder0904/hello-electron).

To run this app, follow these steps -

# (1) Clone this repo

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:deadcoder0904/hello-electron.git
```

# (2) Go into the directory

```bash
$ cd hello-electron
```

# (3) Install all the Dependencies

```bash
$ yarn
```

# (4) Start the Application

```bash
$ yarn start
```

### Till the next time ðŸ‘»
