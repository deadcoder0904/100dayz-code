# DAY 93 ðŸ‘¾ 

### I'm back ðŸ’™

#### Today I created Subscription Newsletter for my blog.

Since I didn't wanted to pay for SendGrid, Mailchimp & the likes, so I created my own Subscription Newsletter which sends email to the subscriber whenever I add new Blog Posts.

### Till the next time ðŸ‘»
