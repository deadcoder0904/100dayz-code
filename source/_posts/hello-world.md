# DAY 1 ðŸ‘¾ 

Hey there. 

This is my very first post. 

I've decided to code for the next 100 dayz in any language starting from Today dated 1st Nov 2016 & blog about it here. 

All my code for the next 100 dayz will be put up on [my Github account](https://github.com/deadcoder0904). Feel free to use any of my Code. 

# How I made this Blog

Welcome into the world of [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)! 

Hexo is a static site generator written in Node JS, the language of my choice ðŸ˜‰. 

I had 3 options to choose from 
(1) **Jekyll**, which uses Ruby Gems, is slow as compared to other 2 options. 
(2) **Hugo**, which is written in Golang, a language with Python like Syntax & C like Speed which is super fast 
and
(3) **Hexo**, which is written in Node JS & on which this blog is built upon. I like Hexo because it uses Javascript & because of some awesome themes which Hugo lacks.

I didn't use Jekyll because I've used it on other site running over [here](https://deadcoder0904.github.io/).

Check [documentation](https://hexo.io/docs/) for more info. If you get any problems when using Hexo, you can find the answer in [troubleshooting](https://hexo.io/docs/troubleshooting.html) or 
you can ask the author's on [GitHub](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/issues).

I've used [CactusDark theme](https://github.com/probberechts/cactus-dark/) in Hexo.

# Automated Deployment Script
