# DAY 22 ðŸ‘¾ 

### I'm back ðŸ’™

#### Today I worked on an Open Source Project called [`Refined Github`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github) created by [`SindreSorhus`](https://github.com/sindresorhus).

> Refined Github is a chrome extension that simplifies the GitHub interface and adds useful features

It is made to fix many dumb annoyances we'd like to fix. So here be dragons.

It has a lot of features.

## Highlights

## Install

Install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/refined-github/hlepfoohegkhhmjieoechaddaejaokhf) or [manually](http://superuser.com/a/247654/6877).

I've created a tiny function on this OSS(Open Source Software). 

The function has the ability to copy a gist to Clipboard using a Copy button. 

It is a very tiny function. I needed to edit only 3 files but learnt a lot in the process as my Code Reviewer is a perfectionist & he suggested edits for every single change I made. 

This is my first big OSS Pull Request which had a lot of reviews which you can see [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github/pull/338). Its still not merged. But, fingers crossed it will be sooner or later. I suggest anyone reading this post to contribute to OSS as you will learn more.

### Till the next time ðŸ‘»
