# DAY 37 ðŸ‘¾ 

### I'm back ðŸ’™

#### Today I created Flexbox Cheatsheet.

It contains only the necessary elements I would require for Frontend Development. 

Its made for quick lookup as a revision incase I forget anything about Flexbox.

Some awesome resources I've used to learn Flexbox which is a really daunting topic are as follows.

1. [What the Flexbox](http://flexbox.io/) - 20 Video Series

2. [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) - Play Froggy Game with Flexbox 

3. [Understanding Flexbox](https://github.com/ohansemmanuel/Understanding-Flexbox) - Read & Understand Flexbox

4. [Flexbox Patterns](www.flexboxpatterns.com/home) - Flexbox with Real Examples
