# DAY 31 ðŸ‘¾ 

### I'm back ðŸ’™

#### Today I created Egghead Downloader using Python's BeautifulSoup.

It is a simple script which downloads all the videos from Egghead.

# Requirements

It just requires `youtube-dl` internally. So make sure to install it.

#### Run the `python` script

```
python index.py
```

#### Enter the full URL like this

```
https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-graphql-server
```

### Till the next time ðŸ‘»
