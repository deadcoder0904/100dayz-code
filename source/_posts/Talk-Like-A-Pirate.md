# DAY 14 ðŸ‘¾ 

### I'm back ðŸ’™

#### Today I created Talk Like A Pirate Site. It is a fun app.

# [Demo](https://deadcoder0904.github.io/talk-like-a-pirate/)

#### You give it a text in English and it will convert the plain English Text to Piratey Language. 

## What

## Explanation

# `Hello my Friend, do you know where I can meet a Woman around here?` 
gets converted to 
# `Avast my Mate, do you know where I can meet a Wench around here?`

### [It uses the API which can be found here](http://isithackday.com/arrpi.php).
