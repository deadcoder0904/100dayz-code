# DAY 84 ðŸ‘¾ 

### I'm back ðŸ’™

#### Today I created Disease Diagnostic System written using React, Node Express, Babel, Webpack in ES6.

# [Demo](https://deadcoder0904.github.io/disease-diagnostic-system-react)

The BACKEND part is well written :heart_eyes: but the FRONTEND of this project sucks in my opinion :joy:

It took me exact 20 hours to complete this project measured here; its too slow :cry: but for a 1st Full Stack MERN Stack I think its great

The time for this project must be not more than 6 hours as its not too complex & only has 1500 Lines Of Code

Anywayz my next projects will be much faster than this one :wink:
