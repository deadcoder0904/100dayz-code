# DAY 13 ðŸ‘¾ 

### I'm back ðŸ’™

#### Today I created Random Profile Generator.

### [The live application can be found here](https://deadcoder0904.github.io/random-names/).

It takes as input the number of Random Names to be generated, the gender of the Random Names & the region for which you want the Random Names for and gives as output the number of Random Names you requested, their age, gender, birthdate & region.

### [It uses the JSON API which can be found here](https://github.com/thm/uinames/).

### [The code used for this application can be found here](https://github.com/deadcoder0904/random-names/).
