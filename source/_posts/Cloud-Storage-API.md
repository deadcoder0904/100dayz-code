# DAY 86 ðŸ‘¾ 

### I'm back ðŸ’™

#### Today I created Cloud Storage API Application.

â€‹Cloud Storage API which â€‹turns any host on network into a HTTP cloud storage service. This project is specifically designed for local area networks to host a Cloud-like storage system and providing a level of abstraction over CLI based methods like SSH or telnet for accessing the server.

Key Advantages : (support for)
1. Restricted access to users 
2. Access policy managable for different users
3. User activity Tracking possible

Users can create File, create Folder, write to a File, remove File, remove Folder & show the contents of the File throught GET & POST requests.
