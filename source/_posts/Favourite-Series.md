# DAY 17 ðŸ‘¾ 

### I'm back ðŸ’™

#### Today I created my Favourite Series Site. I have used [OMDB API](https://omdbapi.com/) to get all the data about various TV Series. 

## ES7 Boilerplate 

I've also created simple ES7 compatible Boilerplate,to `require` files & to use various new ES7 methods, which can be found [here](https://github.com/deadcoder0904/template-scripts/tree/master/HTML5-CSS3-Jquery-Tachyons-ES7/).

To run this app, follow these steps -

# (1) Clone this repo

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:deadcoder0904/favourite-series.git
```

# (2) Go into the directory

```bash
$ cd favourite-series
```

# (3) Install all the Dependencies

```bash
$ yarn
```

# (4) Build the Application

```bash
$ yarn start
```

# (5) Open `index.html` in your favourite browser
